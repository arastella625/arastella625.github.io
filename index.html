    <h1>Welcome To Amber's Programming Portfolio</h1>
      
<p>
    This website I have created is a part of my assignment for my CSC 106: Joy of Programming class. <br>
    It has been one of the first test of skills that I will need in the future. Despite its basic <br>
    design, there is a lot more in the background that goes on to the success of your favorite websites. <br>
    <strong>I hope you enjoy!</strong>
