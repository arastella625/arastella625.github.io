        <h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
    Hello, my name is Amber Rastella and I am currently a Junior majoring in Computer Science<br> 
    with a minor in Cybersecurity at University of Rhode Island. My hope is to joing the accelerated<br>
    Bachelor's to Master's program in Cybersecurity. I am currently in the National Guard and will<br>
    probably work federally once I graduate. The small work I have done so far here creating my first<br>
    website has been exciting and I cannot wait for everything else I will get to learn during my time<br>
    at URI and in this major.</p>
