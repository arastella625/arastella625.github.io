          <h1> Welcome to Our Homepage!</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to our Final Project! Here, me and Angelina Biafore have our final project for CSC 106. We also have added a
            PDF Document of our partner contract that we used to enable our success in creating this project!
            </p>
        <h2> Partner Agreement </h2>

        <h3> Final Project Game </h3>
            <p>
                 This game is a simple take on asteroids! In order to play it, all you have to do is press the start game button and 
                get ready with the spacebar! You see you will be able to shoot missiles by pressing down on the spacebar button. 
                Continue shooting until there are no more asteroids left! Be quick though, because if they reach the bottom and hit 
                you at your base, you lose!   
        </p>
